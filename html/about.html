                        <p> a software engineer having vast interest in different stack of software technology. Starting from embedded system and microcontrollers using C; to mobile phone projects using Java; recently starting to play around with VR and game development in Unity3D and Unreal Engine. Welcome to my website, I will be frequently updating this website featuring more pet-projects I have been doing. If you like any part of website, feel free to checkout the Github.

                                <p>At jNet ThingsX, I have been learning a lot from this position, not only in terms of better coding practices and algorithm implementations; as well as general knowledge of good engineer practices, and understanding of project lifecycles.</p>
                                <p>I have been developing secure embedded application on both native OS and JavaCard OS. I was fortunate that I got to involve in full development lifecycle - from architecturing to final certification - on my first project. The project was a secure embedded application solution that features top-of-the-line ePassport solution in both performance and security. Afterward, I moved to refactoring and improving existing JavaCard OS functionalities, as well as enhancing OS features.</p>
                                <p>I was introduced to some other important concepts and ways of doing things other than technical enhancement; including agile management, good git branching practices, automations, integration testings, certification processes, etc.</p>
